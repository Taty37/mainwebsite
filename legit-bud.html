				<h3>CLIENT OVERVIEW</h3>
						<p>
							Legit Bud Store is an online dispensary that is based in California that delivers medicinal marijuana across the United States, but internationally as well. Their mission is to provide service to everyone who needs it in the easiest way possible.
						</p>
						<h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
						<p>
							For Legit Bud Store to be a global company, sales were not to their expectancy. They wanted to appeal to a larger customer base and give their consumers a smooth checkout process that will excite them to revisit and reuse their delivery service time and time again. 
						</p>
						<h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
						<p>
							My goal for LBS was to redesign their website in order to increase traffic and sales by researching the cannabis industry, revamping the home page, developing a more intuitive navigation and comfortable and quick checkout process.

			<h3>LEARNING THE INDUSTRY</h3>
				<p>
					Cannabis delivery has hit the California area by storm. In southern Californian cities, “delivery is king”, as Lauren Yoshiko from Forbes magazine would say. Eaze, an online cannabis marketplace and delivery app, facilitates more than 500,000 deliveries alone since the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes began in January. Users want their products fast, in good quality with full discretion.
				</p>
					<div>
						<h4>COMPETITIVE &amp; COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
							<p>
								Many surrounding companies were successfully doing this, so I did a Comparative and Competitive Analysis to see where LBS matched up and this is what I found:
								<ul class="bullet">
									<li>All demographics were catered to (novice and advanced smokers)</li>
									<li>Even though California accepts recreational purchases, a rec card was still required on each website</li>
									<li>Delivery was limited to local areas</li>
									<li>Customer feedback was president</li>
									<li>Standard payment methods included Credit Card and cash</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<h4>HEURISTIC EVALUATION</h4>
								<p>
									After researching the cannabis delivery industry and other competitors, I went back to LBS and did a full scrub of their website. A Heuristic Evaluation brought to my attention that LBS were not following the industry standards. For instance:
									<br>
									<ul class="bullet">
									<li>The site didn’t specify the demographic they were catering to</li>
									<li>The navigation was not cohesive with its items</li>
									<li>Support was not active</li>
									<li>Pay options were not common (CashApp, Walmart &amp; Bitcoin)</li>
									<li>No Reviews on any of the products</li>
									<li>No rec/medical marijuana card requirement</li>
									<li>No Social Media presence</li>
								</ul>
								Below you can see my Evaluation in full detail:

							<h4>HEURISTIC EVALUATION</h4>
								<p>
									I conducted 7 user Interviews that included long time cannabis users, recreational, medicinal and friends of cannabis. The interviews gave me great insight on what our users were looking for when purchasing cannabis for delivery on a web platform. 
									<br>
									<br>
									Here are a few things that were mentioned:

			<h3>LISTENING TO OUR USERS</h3>
				<p>
					From the information I gathered, the biggest challenge was to synthesize and accommodate our users in a way that best fits their needs while keeping the company abreast with the industry standards.
				</p>
			<div>
				<h4>USER FLOW</h4>
					<p>
						Even though I did several flows of my own of the website, the goal was to make sure the site was intuitive and seamless for our users. There is where I found further frustrations that needed to be addressed. 9 out 10 of my users exited the website without attempting to go through the checkout process. Only 1 understood what Bitcoin was and how it could be used.
						<ul class="quotes">
							<li><em>“I don’t know where to start.”</em></li>
							<li><em>“340 dollars?! Why is this so expensive?”</em></li>
							<li><em>“Cash App, Walmart and Western Union? Thats kind of sketch.”</em></li>
							<li><em>“I have no way to pay for this… I guess I will just fly back to Seattle and walk down to the store and get my brownies.”</em></li>
						</ul>		
					</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>FEATURE PRIORITIZATION</h4>
					<p>
						So what's more effective for this site in order to increase traffic, sales and loyalty?
						<ul class="bullet">
							<li>CC/Paypal payment options</li>
							<li>Designated featured products</li>
							<li>Interactive search bar</li>
							<li><strong>Same day delivery</strong> or a membership based delivery system</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

			<div>
				<h4>PERSONA</h4>
					<p>
						Further synthesizing lead to our persona creation. Meet Teagan, a casual cyclist who although quite frugal, one who appreciates quality and clean aesthetics. She loves being outdoors when she isn’t busy with her Tech startup and finding ways to spend quality time with her husband. Teagan created the path for our design ideation.

			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>JOURNEY MAP</h4>
					<p>
						From the insight collected in our <strong>user task flow, contextual inquiry</strong> and interviews, we were able to use Teagan to demonstrate her experience of Linus website by creating an existing Customer Journey Map. There were frustrations about not finding the product info and there was no way to preview the accessories on the bike chosen or any bike for that matter. The whole experience seamed unexpectedly challenging and pretty overwhelming.

			<h2>BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER</h2>
				<p>
					“Our consumers have a high rating of returning the accessories for their bikes after purchase due to it not being what they expected. They want the ability to customize their items. How might we help enhance their shopping experience?”

			<h3>DESIGN THINKING FOCUS</h3>
				<p>
					As the person in charge of the wireframes and UI, I believed that it was important to do a high-fidelity mockup to exhibit the depth of an app ready to launch. I fabricated a style guide for my team in order to stay in line with the simple beauty of the current Linus website. Collectively we narrowed down the color scheme and got to work. 			
				</p>
			<div>
				<h4>USER FLOW</h4>
					<p>
						But, before we headed to the wihiteboard, we wanted to comb through the user flow to ensure our users had not only a pleasant experience, but a seamless, functional one.
						<br>
						<br>
						Below you can see what the current flow is:

				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>DESIGN STUDIO</h4>
					<p>
						In order to get acquainted with effective time-boxing, we set up a design studio to sketch out an Events page that we would be building for the app in 10 minute increments. The final design was iterated three times before landing in the hi-fi mockup after we learned critical information about possible outdated UI interactions and what was more appealing to the users. We fostered this design thinking process across the entire app and into the e-commerce flow. Our promise was to keep the user in mind throughout this sprint with a clear and concise purpose.

				<h4>SKETCHES</h4>
					<p>
						Before tackling hi-fidelity, I went through a few sketches in my pad to help conclude a final design decision.

			<h3>TRIAL AND ERROR</h3>
				<p>
					After 6 days of user testing and 74 artboards of iteration later, we have procured a user-centered design that addressed the challenges of keeping up with society and exceeding the technical advances for the cyclist retail community.

				<h4>USABILITY TESTING</h4>
					<p>
						In the beginning was confident that our design choices were iron clad until we came across several road blocks in our user testing phase. Again, users didn’t know what the AR symbol stood for, so I had to find a way to onboard the process.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text-banner"> 
				<p>
					<em>“Let’s put italicized text next to the symbol in red.” <span>FAIL</span></em>
					<br>
					<br>
					<em>“Maybe I should create a raised button around the symbol to indicate that it needs to be pressed.”<span>FAIL</span></em>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				insert image here
			</div>
			<p>
				Users would just add each item to the cart and go through the whole checkout process thinking that they would be able to see their customization at the end. Our objective was for them to use the customization feature before adding anything to their cart.
			</p>
			<div>
				<h4>ITERATION</h4>
					<p>
						I continued to watch the user flow of each person we tested in order to find a pattern and I discovered that people naturally look for the “Add to Cart” button no matter the task. So to overcome the challenge of our feature being overlooked, I implemented a “Customize Bike” button with the AR symbol as a reference in order to get them accustomed to that visual lingo. Only then the light bulb went up. A common comment was, <span><em>“Oh wait, I just saw that symbol! So that’s what it means.”</em></span>
					</p>
			</div>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>PROTOTYPE</h4>
					<p>
						Through research and constant user testing, we were able to
						<br>
						<span><strong><u>RE-DEFINE THE BRAND</u></strong></span> with a simple solution to provide visually appealing and solicitous events within the app.
						<br>And……..
						<br>
						<span><strong><u>OVERCOME THE RETURN STATISTIC</u></strong></span> by giving our users the ability to not only customize their bikes, but the option to add their accessories straight to the cart from the AR screen!
						<br>
						<br>

			<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
				<p>
					Although we were able to successfully portray the idea of using AR technology and gained incredible insight from testing and retesting the AR rendering, I would have liked to explore a way to prototype using actual AR software and have access to the users’ camera to display real room placement for their bikes. Overall I really enjoyed working with this client because I was able to learn a new technology that I had very little experience with. I am now completely intrigued with using this technology with more products in the future.
