    			<h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
    			<p>
    			Today’s cannabis consumers have increased diversity with a need of variety to fit multiple lifestyles and wellnesses. With marijuana demand increasing by 18% since 2016, a recent study shows that orders placed online has increased by 200% resulting in an order <strong>every 10 seconds.</strong>

    				Dispensaries in the state of California on average close by 10pm. Many of the users interviewed who worked late nights or had limited mobility depended on the flexibility  and urgency that cannabis delivery offers them. 
    				<br>
    				<br>
					And although 90% of the users are repeat buyers, research shows that on average consumers only <strong>spend between $25 - $50 per order.</strong> Of those users, 34% usually are looking for a single item like a half gram pre-roll. Only 8.2% spend more than $100.

    				<p>
    				The importance of reaching the average consumer and not just 8% was the reason why I took on the Legit Bud Store website challenge, The consensus of the challenge was to redesign their website with the following in mind:
    					<ul class="bullet">
    						<li>The navigation has to be <strong>clear and concise</strong> to alleviate the rabbit hole of categories</li><br>
    						<li>Users must be able to go through the checkout and delivery process <strong>seamlessly</strong> without having to learn new methods of payment</li><br>
    						<li>It has to be <strong>unique, yet feel familiar</strong> to the user in ways of comfort and affordability</li> 
    					</ul>
    				</p>
    			</div>
    		</div>
            <h2><strong>KEY PAIN POINTS</strong></h2>
    		<div class="content pain-point">
    			<div class="pain-1">
    			<p>
    				Can you think about a time where you visited a site and couldn’t find what you were looking for because the options led you down a path that caused you to eventually give up?
    			</p>
    			</div>
    			<div class="pain-2">
    			<p>
    				What about when you go to buy an item online and you get to the checkout process and start to feel overwhelmed?
    				<ul class="bullet">
    					<li>Why are there so many fields for promo codes or rebates even though no deals were present on the site?</li><br>
    					<li>Will adding my phone number cause spam calls?</li><br>
    					<li><strong>Do I HAVE to create an account?</strong></li><br>
    					<li>What is Bitcoin?</li>
    				</ul>
    			</p>
    			</div>
    			<div class="pain-1">
    			<p>
    				After this long drawn out process, is buying this item even worth it? Studies show that 27% of users will abandon the website if the process is too long and complicated. See Below:

    					So these are the pain points I have to solve:
    					<ul class="bullet">
    						<li>How to make a <strong>more appealing and inviting navigation</strong> throughout the site.</li><br>
    						<li>How to incorporate a more effective and <strong>pleasant checkout flow</strong>.</li><br>
    						<li>How to accommodate the average buyer to increase sales and traffic to the site while <strong>gaining loyalty.</strong></li>
    					</ul>

    				<h3>EXECUTION: THE DESIGN</h3>
    					<p>
    						To the drawing board I went. The beginning phases of the design started with pen &amp; paper, which ultimately transferred over to hi-fidelity wireframes in Sketch
    						<br>
    						<br>
    						<strong>During the design process, my goal was to provide pleasure for all users no matter the lifestyle or need.</strong>

    					<p>
    						The 1st Solution was to give the category photos on the homepage hierarchy over the navigation buttons because it made the users feel more “engaged”.

    			<div class="design-4">
    				<div class="d3">
    					<p>
    						The 2nd Solution was to develop a modal checkout flow. It allowed the process to feel conversational and only asked what was necessary to complete the order.

    			<h3>TAKEAWAYS</h3>
    			<p>
    				This project allowed me to understand how important something that is as simple as the navigation placement can affect how people interact with your product. Also, knowing your market/target user plays the biggest part in your success as a company. I believe that as the industries evolve, so should we.
