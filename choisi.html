                <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>    
                    <p>With Choisi being a high-fashion online retail startup, they wanted to be different from the usual brand fashion retailers and find a way to bridge the gap between finding sustainable independent designers and high-fashion consumers, while creating a very personalized experience from exploration to completion</p>

                    <p>Our goal was to create a personalized luxury e-commerce website that represented designer discovery with a curated experience.

                    <p>So, what was the problem? Well to start, Choisi didn’t have an official e-commerce platform. According to their Google Analytics, there was a bounce rate of 60% because the second you clicked on an item you managed to find, it directed you to an external site with no connection to get you back, making Choisi’s website lack memorability. During our evaluation of the current site, the main points were;
                    </p>

                    <ul class="choisi-list">
                        <li>Users couldn’t figure out what items were available for purchase.</li>
                        <li>They were overwhelmed with the list of designers they had no knowledge about. It didn’t help that their bio pages were inconsistent and lacked organization.</li>
                        <li>Last but not least, the website didn’t appear to appeal to their target audience of luxury high-end fashion consumers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To be sure we could cover all the bases of a standard e-commerce platform, we took to competitors like Zara, Of a Kind, Chanel and Louis Vuitton to compare what they had to offer their consumers. Choisi proved to have a unique value proposition with giving exposure to independent designers, but it overlooked the basic elements like product listings and filters, a simple checkout flow, account setup with the ability to save items for later.</p>

                <p>Priorities set in to place after countless interviews and user tests allowing us to narrow down which features took precedent. The goal was to tackle the "low hanging fruit' of building an e-commerce flow. Before moving on to any personalization features, the site needed;</p>

Those features were, "Shop this Look" - an outfit already styled and giving the users a place to find those items without having to search around, “Finish the Look" - which gave users an idea of what they could pair with the item they intended on purchasing,  and "Editors' Picks"- Top lists that were curated from trusted editors for the users that were looking to make a statement.</p>

                    <p>What I loved the most about the design phase is when we asked the co-founder to come in and participate in a Design Studio with us to inspire creation across the board. With her sharing her input, we were able to bring together a Product Detail Page that was streamlined, personalized and elegant. She actually called it "Sexy." I am very proud of that moment.</p>
                    <p>We A/B and user tested using our paper and whiteboard sketches. I gained knowledge of where users naturally clicked when selecting an item. There was a 50/50 split between users clicking on the image versus the detail text. Testing content hierarchy was next. What did users prefer to see first when coming to a site? How important was learning about the company or designers? We found that even though people wanted to know about Choisi, they didn't care for much detail about it when shopping. They did want access to the designers' bio though. </p>

                <p>Before, users were immediately redirected from the site the second they clicked on an individual product. They could be on the site for as little as 7 to 10 seconds before being redirected.  Now, if users have a willingness to buy an item, they can do so directly on the site, causing the bounce rate drop 40% and giving users more of an incentive to stay on the site longer while feeling confident in their online shopping experience.</p>

                    <p>But the fun doesn't stop here. What I appreciate about Choisi is that they are completely open about expanding what they can do with their brand. Wanting to stay current, the plan is to connect the content they share on their Instagram Page to a direct shopping experience if their followers were interested in where they could buy such items.</p>

                    <p>There is also a plan in motion to keep user engaged with their site by allowing user generated content. Giving users space to create a "LookBook" of their own and allowing members to discover designers all over the world. Turning Choisi into not just a typical retail platform, but a fashion community, which is something I am extremely excited about.</p>

                <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
                <p>I am very thankful for the opportunity I had working with Choisi because I learned that the smallest details have the biggest impact. How just having simple things that users are already used to like a shopping cart icon will decrease confusion of the site being one big portfolio versus and actual place for them to shop. Also, in this case, SIZE DOES MATTER. Thumbnail sized images weren't going to work when such company is asking for their users to make an investment in their online retail platform. Ii was such a great time being able to share ideas with my team and would do this all again.</p>
