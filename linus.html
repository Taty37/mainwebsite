    			<h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
    			<p>
    			As a company that offers a broad range of bicycles and accessories for both the casual and commuter cyclists, Linus wanted to lower returns by offering their customers a way to customize their own bikes. Additionally, Linus wanted to expand their brand beyond retail by embracing the values of community and ecology. There was a great need to encompass the mindset and lifestyle of their customers.

    				From our user research, a typical bike buyer wants to get it in store.  BUT, reality is that retail continues to shift to E-Commerce.  People want to buy things online, including <strong>BIKES</strong>. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/249863/us-mobile-retail-commerce-sales-as-percentage-of-e-commerce-sales/">Studies</a> show that in 3 years, over half of e-commerce will be on our phones!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The number of cyclists/bike riders in the U.S. has increased over the past three years from around 43 million to 47.5 million in 2017 with a majority of those users purchasing their bikes online.
                    <br>

                    <em>“We’ve been seeing many online-only bike retailers without a storefront.”</em>

    				<p>
    				    With Linus wanting to make a deep connection with its community, they successfully gave us great interest in this project. The agreement for this challenge was to develop an app with the following in mind:
    					<ul class="bullet">
    						<li>Increase <strong>engagement</strong> with the brand and its community</li><br>
    						<li>Find a form of technology to <strong>streamline bike customization</strong></li><br>
    						<li>Adopt the clean asthetic of the website while incorporating a <strong>smooth and consistent checkout flow</strong></li> 
    					</ul>
    				</p>
    			</div>
    		</div>
             <h2><strong>KEY PAIN POINTS</strong></h2>
    		<div class="content pain-point">
    			<div class="pain-1">
    			<p>
    				How many times have you ordered an item online only to return it because it wasn't what you expected or didn't fit even though it said it would?
    			</p>
    			</div>
    			<div class="pain-2">
    			<p>
    				What about when a company promotes "personalization", yet there's no way to make the product your own?
    				<ul class="bullet">
    					<li>Am I supposed to guess that this will look great together?</li><br>
    					<li>Are there any pictures that will at least give me an idea?</li><br>
    					<li><strong>Did I already order this?</strong></li><br>
    					<li>Is customization the new word for imagination?</li>
    				</ul>
    			</p>
    			</div>
    			<div class="pain-1">	
    			<p>
    				Lastly, have you ever followed that company on social media for the culture only to find out there really isn't one? The social usage motivation with the biggest increase since 2015 is using social to research products and brand's purpose.

    					<strong class="call-text">Users tend to buy based soley on emotion and social concious. With the growth of instant gratification, they want to see their choices in real time. That will give them comfort and confidence.</strong>

    					So here's what we are looking to solve:
    					<ul class="bullet">
    						<li>How to get the brand more <strong>involved</strong> with the community and <strong>social sharing</strong>.</li><br>
                            <li>How to develop a <strong>fully functional</strong> customization feature that allows users to change/add accessories to the bike of thier choice.</li><br>
    						<li>How to enhance and <strong>expand Linus's image</strong> that matches our users' self-perception and desires using a mobile app.</li>

    				<h3>EXECUTION: THE DESIGN</h3>
    					<p>
    						Challenge accepted. We took to the drawing board to synthesize our findings by fleshing out the feature prioritization. That led us from sketches to Hi-fidelity Wireframes.
    						<br>
    						<br>
    						As the person in charge of the UX and UI elements in the design process, my goal was to exhibit the depth of an app ready to launch that ensured our users <strong>have not only a pleasant experience, but a seamless, functional one.</strong>
    					</p>
    				</div>
    				</div>
    			</div>
    			<div class="design-3">
    				<div class="d3">
    					<p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
    						The 1st Solution was to partner up with local businesses and organizations to create events that users would be able to find and participate in directly from the app. 
    					</p>
    				</div>
    				<div class="support">
    					<img src="images/events-mockup@3x.png" alt="Events Mockup" class="responsive">

                            <br>
                            <br>
    						The 2nd Solution was to use <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> technology to allow users a way to customize their bikes and see it in real time in their current location.
    					</p>
    				</div>
    				<div class="support">
    					<img src="images/ar-fully-mockup@3x.png" alt="AR Mockup" class="responsive">

    			</div>
    			<div class="design-5">
    				<div class="d3">
    					<p>
    						My last Solution was to give comfort in the checkout process by adding the ability to add items straight to the cart from the AR platform. That eliminated users having to go find the items after seeing them virtually on their bikes.
    					</p>
    				</div>

    			<h3>EXECUTION: THE PROTOTYPE</h3>

    				Let’s walk through how we combined all solutions given with this clickable prototype that I developed through InVision:

    			<h3>TAKEAWAYS</h3>
    			<p>
    				Although we were able to successfully portray the idea of using AR technology and gained incredible insight from testing and retesting the AR rendering, I would have liked to explore a way to prototype using actual AR software and have access to the users’ camera to display real room placement for their bikes. Overall I really enjoyed working with this client because I was able to learn a new technology that I had very little experience with. I am now completely intrigued with using this technology with more products in the future.
