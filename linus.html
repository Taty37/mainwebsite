				<h3>CLIENT OVERVIEW</h3>
						<p>
							Inspired by French bicycle design of the 50s and 60s, Linus Bikes created bicycles that preserves the elegance and pure form of that era. The founders Adam McDermott and Chad Kushner brought their influence to Venice, CA to give consumers “a simple, elegant bike for riding around and doing stuff.”
						</p>
						<h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
						<p>
							As a company that offers a broad range of bicycles and accessories for both the casual and commuter cyclists, they wanted to offer the ability to customize their own bikes in order to generate more sales and lower their return rate. Additionally, Linus wanted to expand their brand beyond retail by embracing the values of community and ecology. There was a great need to encompass the mindset and lifestyle of their customers.
						</p>
						<h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
						<p>
							Our goal was to build a mobile app using Augmented Reality technology to streamline bike customization and increase engagement with the brand through social sharing events and stamping the hashtag <span>#LINUSLIFESTYLE</span>.

			<h3>UNDERSTANDING OUR USERS</h3>
				<p>
					We started by making our way down to the Linus store location in Venice, CA to get an understanding of their customer base. We found that most of the users were practical buyers who enjoyed the vintage style. Most of the purchases were made online with only an average 10% of their sales were made in store.

						<h4>USER INTERVIEWS</h4>

					<div>
						<h4>COMPETITIVE AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
							<p>
								We conducted a C &amp; C Analysis to find out what the competitors were doing. The focus was to uncover what features were boosting their users’ experiences. Some of the biggest competitors were Solé, Pure Cycles and Civia and this is what we were able to unearth:
								<ul class="bullet">
									<li><strong>Social Sharing</strong> was predominate across each platform</li>
									<li>Product Videos gave a <strong>better description</strong> of each item</li>
									<li><strong>Customization</strong> was only offered with one competitor</li>
									<li>Only <strong>one large competitor</strong> had the use of AR technology</li>
								</ul>

							<h4>BRAND ASSESSMENT</h4>
								<p>
									From our research, Linus Bike has a strong image which matches our customer bases’ self-perception and desires. Our users aspire to a stylish, vintage aesthetic. They also want to reflect a lifestyle that is hip/urban yet embraces a love of the outdoors and the environment. So, the question was:

									<span><em>“How do we enhance and expand this image using our mobile app?”</em></span>

			<h3>LISTENING TO OUR USERS</h3>
				<p>
					Taking the information from the 10 user interviews we did, our biggest challenge was making sure our users’ wants and needs were met without overloading them with features and information on such a clean and simple site.
				</p>
			<div>
				<h4>FEATURE PRIORITIZATION</h4>
					<p>
						Challenge accepted. We took to the drawing board to synthesize our findings by creating a feature prioritization board to flesh out what mattered most to our users and AR technology was one of the top features.
					</p>
				<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>AFFINITY MAPPING</h4>
					<p>
						Everyone wanted access to see their product in real time. They expressed the need to customize with comfort and confidence. We nicknamed it the “C&amp;C Effect,” and our affinity mapping process really allowed us to hone in on these discoveries.
					</p>
				<div>
					insert image here
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>PERSONA</h4>
					<p>
						Further synthesizing lead to our persona creation. Meet Teagan, a casual cyclist who although quite frugal, one who appreciates quality and clean aesthetics. She loves being outdoors when she isn’t busy with her Tech startup and finding ways to spend quality time with her husband. Teagan created the path for our design ideation.

				<h4>JOURNEY MAP</h4>
					<p>
						From the insight collected in our <strong>user task flow, contextual inquiry</strong> and interviews, we were able to use Teagan to demonstrate her experience of Linus website by creating an existing Customer Journey Map. There were frustrations about not finding the product info and there was no way to preview the accessories on the bike chosen or any bike for that matter. The whole experience seamed unexpectedly challenging and pretty overwhelming.

			<h2>BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER</h2>

			<h3>DESIGN THINKING FOCUS</h3>
				<p>
					As the person in charge of the wireframes and UI, I believed that it was important to do a high-fidelity mockup to exhibit the depth of an app ready to launch. I fabricated a style guide for my team in order to stay in line with the simple beauty of the current Linus website. Collectively we narrowed down the color scheme and got to work. 			
				</p>
			<div>
				<h4>USER FLOW</h4>
					<p>
						But, before we headed to the whiteboard, we wanted to comb through the user flow to ensure our users had not only a pleasant experience, but a seamless, functional one.
						<br>
						<br>
						Below you can see what the current flow is:

				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>DESIGN STUDIO</h4>
					<p>
						In order to get acquainted with effective time-boxing, we set up a design studio to sketch out an Events page that we would be building for the app in 10 minute increments. The final design was iterated three times before landing in the hi-fi mockup after we learned critical information about possible outdated UI interactions and what was more appealing to the users. We fostered this design thinking process across the entire app and into the e-commerce flow. Our promise was to keep the user in mind throughout this sprint with a clear and concise purpose.

				<h4>SKETCHES</h4>
					<p>
						Before tackling hi-fidelity, I went through a few sketches in my pad to help conclude a final design decision.

			<h3>TRIAL AND ERROR</h3>
				<p>
					After 6 days of user testing and 74 artboards of iteration later, we have procured a user-centered design that addressed the challenges of keeping up with society and exceeding the technical advances for the cyclist retail community.

				<h4>USABILITY TESTING</h4>
					<p>
						In the beginning was confident that our design choices were iron clad until we came across several road blocks in our user testing phase. Again, users didn’t know what the AR symbol stood for, so I had to find a way to onboard the process.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text-banner"> 
				<p>
					<em>“Let’s put italicized text next to the symbol in red.” <span>FAIL</span></em>
					<br>
					<br>
					<em>“Maybe I should create a raised button around the symbol to indicate that it needs to be pressed.”<span>FAIL</span></em>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				insert image here
			</div>
			<p>
				Users would just add each item to the cart and go through the whole checkout process thinking that they would be able to see their customization at the end. Our objective was for them to use the customization feature before adding anything to their cart.
			</p>
			<div>
				<h4>ITERATION</h4>
					<p>
						I continued to watch the user flow of each person we tested in order to find a pattern and I discovered that people naturally look for the “Add to Cart” button no matter the task. So to overcome the challenge of our feature being overlooked, I implemented a “Customize Bike” button with the AR symbol as a reference in order to get them accustomed to that visual lingo. Only then the light bulb went up. A common comment was, <span><em>“Oh wait, I just saw that symbol! So that’s what it means.”</em></span>
					</p>
			</div>
			<div>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>PROTOTYPE</h4>
					<p>
						Through research and constant user testing, we were able to
						<br>
						<span><strong><u>RE-DEFINE THE BRAND</u></strong></span> with a simple solution to provide visually appealing and solicitous events within the app.
						<br>And……..
						<br>
						<span><strong><u>OVERCOME THE RETURN STATISTIC</u></strong></span> by giving our users the ability to not only customize their bikes, but the option to add their accessories straight to the cart from the AR screen!
						<br>
						<br>
						Please see the prototype in action below:

			<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
				<p>
					Although we were able to successfully portray the idea of using AR technology and gained incredible insight from testing and retesting the AR rendering, I would have liked to explore a way to prototype using actual AR software and have access to the users’ camera to display real room placement for their bikes. Overall I really enjoyed working with this client because I was able to learn a new technology that I had very little experience with. I am now completely intrigued with using this technology with more products in the future.
