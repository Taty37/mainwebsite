                                I want to <span class="alert-text"><strong>create things that MATTER</strong></span>. From Law Enforcement Officer to Sales Manager to now Designer, I have learned that my passion is <span class="alert-text"><strong>PEOPLE</strong></span>. Understanding and really listening to what works for them wakes me up each morning with a smile on my face. Although I've fallen flat on my face from time to time, I pride myself in <span class="alert-text"><strong>being WRONG</strong></span> and working through the night just to get it right. Even then, the results may be inconclusive, lol. They were just gifts of improvement telling me to look harder/dig deeper. I strive to be better with each failed attempt and my addiction to learning pushes the meter for me.

                                .... or it could be my addiction to pizza.... who knows

                                All in all, if Pinky and The Brain thought they could take over/change the world, I don't see why I can't try.

                                .... oh yeah, I can code too. This portfolio has been coded using <span class="alert-text"><strong>HTML, CSS and Javascript by myself</strong></span>.
